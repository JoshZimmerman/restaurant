## Purpose
- Learning to use Webpack to aid in web development and use it to bundle modules.
- Learn to organize code using a module structure.

## Requirements
- The restaurant website should use tabbed browsing to access Contact and Menu pages.
- The contents of each 'tab' should be in its own module and dynamically add its content to the page.
- The functionality should include tab switching behavior. So each time a new tab is opened the page is wiped and redrawn with the correct tab's content.
